# MyFinHub Code Health — Changing Plan

## Purpose

Durable continuation plan for the post-Phase-1 code-health cleanup. A future ChatGPT session must be able to resume from GitHub without relying on chat memory. GitHub is the source of truth; recorded SHAs/checks are checkpoints, not permission to ignore newer repository state.

## Protected constraints

- Never inspect, open, quote, summarize, comment on, modify, or use GitHub issue #266.
- `develop` is the integration branch. `main` is release-only.
- No `develop -> main`, release, publish, deploy, production migration, or production-data mutation without separate explicit owner authorization.
- Preserve the owner-approved Phase-1 UI appearance unless a later owner-approved target explicitly changes it.
- Preserve finance/accounting semantics, auth/MFA/RLS/security behavior, persistence, routes, APIs, database contracts and Windows/Desktop behavior unless a stage explicitly requires a compatible fix.
- Code-health work is behavior-preserving by default. Never weaken tests, audits, accessibility, performance, security or installer gates to make a change pass.
- Keep app-owned inputs/selects/date controls; do not regress to browser-native controls where the app already owns the interaction.
- Work in bounded stages/PRs. Recover the real GitHub state before every write and resume existing work rather than creating duplicates.
- Merge code-health PRs back to `develop` with the repository-required validation green; verify the resulting `develop` integration before starting the next write branch.

## Canonical UI contracts

| Concern | Canonical contract |
| --- | --- |
| Text input | `AppTextInput` |
| Textarea | `AppTextarea` |
| Select/dropdown | `AppSelectInput` |
| Date | `AppDateInput` |
| Money/amount | `MoneyInput` |
| Category | `CategorySelectInput` |
| Validation | `FormError` |
| Modal focus | `useModalFocus` |
| Dialog shell | `DialogShell` for eligible modal shells; preserve specialized dialog/picker semantics |
| App frame | `AppShell` |
| Page frame | `page-stack` + `page-heading` |
| Theme | existing semantic light/dark tokens |
| Buttons | shared `Button` + `IconButton`; intentional domain/composite controls may remain raw |
| Generic surfaces | future shared `Surface` base (`raised` / `flat` / `inset`); domain cards remain semantic components |

## Stage plan

### Stage 0 — Production-hotfix back-sync into `develop` — COMPLETE

- [x] Preserve `/api/android-update` while routing it through an existing Vercel function.
- [x] Preserve develop-only account/device capabilities while keeping the Vercel function budget at 12.
- [x] Add regression coverage for routing/function budget.
- [x] Fix Windows CRLF-sensitive source assertions without weakening contracts.
- [x] Refresh Desktop transitive `js-yaml` to patched `4.3.2` while retaining the high-severity audit gate.
- [x] Full required gates green and merged.

Completed delivery: PR #358, `develop@399253c35740a0c6666e60ec2d0eb131d82fb17d`.

### Stage 1 — Persist design-system contracts and inventory — COMPLETE

- [x] Replace bootstrap/TBD design-system and page-pattern docs with approved Phase-1 contracts.
- [x] Inventory buttons, dialogs, generic surfaces and CSS ownership.
- [x] Record intentional domain exceptions.
- [x] Add durable source-level adoption guards.
- [x] Validate, merge and verify integration.

Completed delivery: PR #359, `develop@11f1e9995a332ee2b5b039281701db3db031e98d`.

### Stage 2 — Canonical `Button` / `IconButton` — COMPLETE

Goal: replace selector-net generic action ownership with typed shared primitives without changing approved visuals, geometry or behavior.

- [x] Introduce typed `Button` variants for primary, secondary, danger and ghost/text-compatible actions while preserving approved CSS hooks.
- [x] Introduce accessible `IconButton` with required accessible `aria-label` and safe default `type="button"`.
- [x] Migrate bounded safe adopter groups incrementally while preserving intentional domain/composite raw controls.
- [x] Remove compatibility aliases after active adopters no longer depend on them.
- [x] Verify keyboard/focus/disabled/submit semantics plus fresh rendered evidence through the bounded migrations.

Delivery history: bounded PRs #363–#379. Final Stage-2 completion PR #379 squash-merged to `develop@84fc1c3b70533f0519b26a69f884fd756d7c965d`; post-merge CI `34679070861`, CodeQL `34679070828`, and Windows Desktop `34679070906` passed.

Intentional raw exceptions remain where a button is a domain/composite control rather than a generic action primitive: card-design radios, payment-card interactions, row/domain navigation controls, segmented/sort controls, taxonomy/composite selectors, and comparable documented cases.

### Stage 3 — Canonical `DialogShell` — ACTIVE

Goal: centralize common modal-shell mechanics only where presentation and behavior contracts genuinely match; do not force pickers/popovers or specialized domain surfaces into one abstraction.

- [x] Establish shared `DialogShell` ownership for canonical backdrop, modal ARIA container, `useModalFocus`, Escape/dismiss behavior and reduced-motion transition policy.
- [x] Batch 1: migrate `ConfirmDialog` and `MoneyEditDialog` while preserving alert/dialog roles, busy guards, validation relationships, actions and CSS/DOM contracts.
- [ ] Batch 2: migrate `QuickAdd` while preserving dirty-close nested confirmation, parent/child focus ownership, split-field autofocus, form semantics and approved Quick Entry presentation.
- [ ] Continue with only eligible dialogs after a fresh contract audit; do not automatically migrate `CardCreateDialog`, `CommandPalette`, product-specific pickers or overlays whose presentation/motion semantics differ.
- [ ] Add header/footer abstractions only if multiple later adopters prove a stable common contract; specialized body/form/destructive/busy behavior remains domain-owned.
- [x] Keep native `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt` prohibited through existing guards.

Batch 1 delivery: PR #380 squash-merged to `develop@490dec1badaf2e0b6571f59d01f3b3be01baaab7` (tree `52df6b2261c3ae4690901d06f5aeb008e87bd145`). Final exact-head CI `34682517666`, CodeQL `34682517632`, Cross-engine `34682517694`, Performance `34682517646`, Windows Desktop `34682517680`, plus ready-triggered Performance `34683083931` passed. Post-merge integration is 3/3 green: CI `34683195957`, CodeQL `34683195937`, Windows Desktop `34683195943`.

Active Batch 2: draft PR #381, branch `chore/357-dialog-shell-batch-2`, based exactly on `develop@490dec1badaf2e0b6571f59d01f3b3be01baaab7`.

### Stage 4 — Canonical `Surface`

- [ ] Introduce raised/flat/inset generic surface ownership.
- [ ] Migrate genuinely generic panels/cards only.
- [ ] Keep KPI/account/payment/attention and other domain cards semantic.

### Stage 5 — CSS ownership cleanup

- [x] Stage-1 inventory documented the current numbered-file graph and hidden loader coupling.
- [ ] Eliminate unrelated component-as-global-stylesheet-loader coupling.
- [ ] Replace numeric loader chains incrementally with named tokens/base/primitives/patterns/pages ownership.
- [ ] Reduce selector duplication and unnecessary `!important` only with proven visual parity.
- [ ] Keep runtime theme code focused on semantic token application rather than broad selector styling.
- [ ] Maintain deterministic visual regression evidence at every batch.

### Stage 6 — Code-hygiene tooling

- [ ] Add a low-noise lint/static-analysis baseline without mass unrelated reformatting.
- [ ] Add reliable unused import/export and dependency-cycle checks.
- [ ] Add formatting enforcement only after a low-noise baseline exists.
- [ ] Review dependency/audit debt without relaxing severity gates.

### Stage 7 — Full cleanup verification

- [ ] Full application/API checks.
- [ ] Cross-page shared-control adoption audit for every routed page/shared component.
- [ ] Rendered desktop/mobile QA for every routed surface.
- [ ] Keyboard/focus/accessibility pass.
- [ ] Windows Desktop / First Run / Clean Launch.
- [ ] CodeQL, cross-engine and performance gates.
- [ ] Personally inspect representative fresh visual evidence.
- [ ] Remove only confirmed dead compatibility code, CSS, imports/exports and obsolete aliases.

### Stage 8 — Release-readiness audit — NO RELEASE AUTHORIZATION

- [ ] Compare final `develop` against `main` again.
- [ ] Confirm Vercel function budget and production routing compatibility.
- [ ] Review migrations/backend/auth/device/provider differences explicitly.
- [ ] Verify no unresolved code-health blockers.
- [ ] Produce a release-readiness checkpoint.
- [ ] Stop before `develop -> main`, release or deploy unless separately authorized by the owner.

## Current checkpoint — 2026-09-12

- **Overall tracker:** #357 — OPEN.
- **Completed stages:** 3/9 (Stages 0, 1, 2).
- **Active stage:** Stage 3 — shared `DialogShell`.
- **Verified integration base:** `develop@490dec1badaf2e0b6571f59d01f3b3be01baaab7`; Batch-1 post-merge CI `34683195957`, CodeQL `34683195937`, Windows Desktop `34683195943` are green.
- **Active delivery:** draft PR #381 / `chore/357-dialog-shell-batch-2`.
- **Batch-2 source scope:** `DialogShell` gains only optional `focusActive` plus optional class composition; `QuickAdd` delegates canonical backdrop/ARIA/focus/motion ownership to the shell. Focused ownership guards are updated. No CSS or finance/auth/API/persistence/routing/database/Windows/release behavior changes.
- **Nested focus contract:** while QuickAdd's dirty-close `ConfirmDialog` is open, QuickAdd stays rendered but supplies `focusActive={!discardOpen}` so the child confirmation owns modal focus. Existing rendered QA still verifies nested Escape behavior, focus return, viewport geometry, touch targets and overflow.
- **Initial Batch-2 source milestone:** `3276bd5a2905a0aaa90eb66f2eb617eab3235bb9` had exactly four intended files. Initial CI `34696948272` ran 685 tests; 684 passed and the sole failure was a stale source assertion still requiring the old direct `open&&!discardOpen` ownership expression.
- **Ownership-guard follow-up:** `bb786b56d5583cf8c83e4120d82ef020abb54255` changed only that stale guard to assert the equivalent `focusActive={!discardOpen}` shell contract. On that head, app and API checks passed before this durable-plan sync; rendered QA and the remaining required gates were still running.
- **Excluded from Batch 2:** `CardCreateDialog` (`picker-*` shell, card preview/design-picker semantics), `CommandPalette` (different backdrop/palette motion contract), `ContextualQuickAdd`, and other product-specific overlays remain unchanged pending separate eligibility audits.
- **Next action:** treat the current branch tip as authoritative; verify its net diff is limited to the intended Batch-2 code/tests plus this plan, wait for exact-head CI/CodeQL/Cross-engine/Performance/Windows 5/5, inspect fresh rendered evidence, clean any generated `visual-qa/**` persistence by fast-forward exact-tree restore if necessary, recheck review blockers, then mark ready and squash-merge to `develop` only. After merge, require fresh `develop` CI + CodeQL + Windows 3/3 before the next write branch.

## Resume procedure for a future chat

1. Read root `AGENTS.md` and directly applicable checked-in rules.
2. Read this file completely and issue #357. Do not inspect the protected excluded issue.
3. Fetch the real `develop`, `main`, active branch/PR, latest commits, checks and unresolved review threads.
4. Treat GitHub as source of truth over any SHA/checkpoint recorded here if the repository has moved.
5. Continue the first incomplete item in the active stage; do not skip an open blocker.
6. Use narrow tests first, then required full gates. Never weaken behavioral/security/audit tests.
7. For UI-affecting refactors, inspect fresh real desktop/mobile rendered evidence before merge.
8. After every meaningful checkpoint update this file plus the active issue/PR with completed scope, exact head where useful, validation state, blockers and exact next action.
9. After a bounded PR is merged and verified on `develop`, create/resume the next bounded branch/PR rather than piling unrelated stages together.
10. Keep #357 open until all stages are complete. No `main`, release or deploy without separate explicit owner authorization.
