## Durable security and finance invariants

- Single-owner authentication remains email/password + mandatory TOTP/AAL2.
- Finance access remains API-authorized and RLS-backed.
- PAN/expiry/CVV are excluded from FinanceData and normal backups and live only in the encrypted owner+AAL2 server card vault.
- `CARD_VAULT_KEY`, service-role credentials and other privileged secrets are never distributed in browser, Windows or Android clients.
- Optimistic revisions, backups, audit/history boundaries and the canonical finance/accounting engine remain authoritative.

## Active provider-branding extension — #481

**Tasks 3/4 · Subtasks 12/13**

- Branch: `feat/481-provider-brand-management`, currently stacked on #479 because it depends on the Storage-first provider schema.
- Goal: manage provider artwork from Settings, support context-aware logo/wordmark/card-mark variants, and create new providers together with their selected artwork.
- Implemented on branch: variant-aware provider API/catalog, owner+AAL2 provider writes, bounded Storage upload/replace, context-aware app/card artwork resolution, Settings management UI, create-provider-with-images flow, and live provider adoption by both card pages.
- Remaining: rendered/manual QA + final reconciliation/validation before PR/merge; the new write migration is tracked as release-pending and has not been applied to production.
- Repository plan: `docs/PROVIDER_BRANDING_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`.
- No new Vercel function, no service-role key in clients, no Android work.

## Next work

Subsequent changes are product fixes against the completed v1.3.0 baseline. Routine implementation remains **Issue → short-lived branch → PR → required checks → squash merge into `develop`**. `main` remains release-only.
